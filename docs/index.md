# Welcome home

Welcome to the BaseCMS platform! We're excited you're here and look forward to seeing what you create! The documentation portal is here to help you on your journey, whether you're looking to use the [GraphQL API](/reference/graphql), build a [Javascript application](/integrate/javascript), or even if you're just [getting started](/learn/guides/getting-started).

Have a look around, and if you can't find what you're looking for -- [let us know](mailto:support@baseplatform.io)!
